## Question 1

Define and draw how a binary tree for the given input sequence looks like: Input Integers: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

```
                9
               /
              8
             /
            7
           /
          6
         /
        5
       /
      4
     /
    3
   /
  2
 /
1
```

## Question 2

Define the tree data structure, with the tree node values being integers.

See explanation in Question 3.

## Question 3

Define an algorithm in language of your choice that can create a more balanced tree over the given input defined in #1.

From the questions/requirements:

1. Define a tree data structure (from #2).
2. Define an algorithm that can create a more balanced tree (from #3).
3. There are red/black (or similar) that can rebalance, but we want something simpler (from #3).
